# CanvasFileSync
Tired of downloading canvas files everyday? Well now you don't have to. 

First, get an api key from your local canvas data portal. If you need help, please go to https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14409-4214861717

After you have your api key, set it appropriately in the grabCourseFiles.py file.
Change the beginning variable to your local canvas and set the courses as the ones you wish to download. The specific course id can be found from your local canvas home page. After clicking on a course, the address bar should look something like https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/38455. The number on the end is the specified course number.

Set this script to run once a day, or a week, depending on what you prefer.
